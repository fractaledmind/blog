    If you start a new Rails project today, you’re probably going to pick Postgres for your database. And if you have a ten year old Rails app, you might be using MySQL. But Rails ships with support for SQLite, a lightweight SQL database. Can that lightweight database be used to make production-ready software? Stephen Margheim joins the show to help us answer that question.

    You've heard the whispers, sensed the hype, but you're still not sure what all the fuss is about with SQLite these days. Join me as we explore the use-cases and benefits of running SQLite in a production environment. Along the way, we will learn why SQLite makes sense as your next production database and how to ensure that your setup is optimized for end-user performance and developer happiness. We will setup and deploy a full Rails application—with caching, background jobs, websockets, and full-text search all backed by SQLite—in these 40 minutes. Come along for the ride!

    Background jobs have become an essential component of any Ruby infrastructure, and, as the Sidekiq Best Practices remind us, it is essential that jobs be "idempotent and transactional." But how do we make our jobs idempotent and transactional? In this talk, we will explore various techniques to make our jobs robust and ACIDic.
