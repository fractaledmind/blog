    Learn how to build and deploy a Rails application using SQLite with hands-on exercises! Together we will take a brand new Rails application and walk through various features and enhancements to make a production-ready, full-featured application using only SQLite. We will take advantage of SQLite's lightweight database files to create separate databases for our data, job queue, cache, error monitoring, etc. We will install and use a SQLite extension to build vector similarity search. We will setup point-in-time backups with Litestream. We will also explore how to deploy your application. By the end of this workshop, you will understand what kinds of applications are a good fit for SQLite, how to build a resilient SQLite on Rails application, and how to scale to 50k+ concurrent users.

    You've heard the whispers, sensed the hype, but you're still not sure what all the fuss is about with SQLite these days. Join me as we explore the use-cases and benefits of running SQLite in a production environment. Along the way, we will learn why SQLite makes sense as your next production database and how to ensure that your setup is optimized for end-user performance and developer happiness. We will setup and deploy a vanilla Rails application to demonstrate both how easy that process can be and how solid the performance is out-of-the-box. We will then explore some of the more advanced features of SQLite and how to use them to your advantage. Finally, we will discuss some of the common pitfalls and how to avoid them. You will leave this talk with a solid understanding of how to get started with SQLite in production and how to ensure that your application is running at peak performance. Come along for the ride!

    If you start a new Rails project today, you’re probably going to pick Postgres for your database. And if you have a ten year old Rails app, you might be using MySQL. But Rails ships with support for SQLite, a lightweight SQL database. Can that lightweight database be used to make production-ready software? Stephen Margheim joins the show to help us answer that question.

    Background jobs have become an essential component of any Ruby infrastructure, and, as the Sidekiq Best Practices remind us, it is essential that jobs be "idempotent and transactional." But how do we make our jobs idempotent and transactional? In this talk, we will explore various techniques to make our jobs robust and ACIDic.
