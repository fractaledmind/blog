  description: |
    SQLite's popularity is on the rise, and likewise the ecosystem of tools around it is growing. Unfortunately, SQLite does not expose its parser for 3rd parties to use independently. This greatly limits the ability of developers to build tools that must interact with SQLite's SQL dialect. And so, I have hand-written a 100% Ruby, 100% compatible parser for SQLite's SQL dialect. In addition, having a complete AST permits us to also generate SQL queries from terse, structured Ruby code. In this talk, I will demonstrate how we ensure that the parser is 100% compatible with SQLite's SQL dialect. We will also explore how the parser is implemented and what kind of AST it produces. Then, we will dive into how to use the parser to build tools that can analyze and manipulate SQL queries. Finally, we will look at how to use the generator to build tools that can generate SQL queries programmatically. As Ruby's only full SQLite SQL parser, this library opens up a world of possibilities for developers.

    Stephen Margheim, a celebrated figure in the Ruby and Rails community, returns to unravel the fascinating intricacies of his latest project—writing a parser for SQLite's SQL dialect in Ruby. He shares his enlightening journey of translating complex SQL syntax, which at first seemed a simple endeavor but soon unfolded into a realm of deep learning and unexpected challenges. Alongside this, Stephen collaborates with Aaron Francis on "High Leverage Rails," a video course designed to spotlight the synergy between Rails and SQLite, offering a treasure trove of insights into developing high-quality applications.

    We dive into the nuanced world of SQL parsing, where Stephen candidly recounts the arduous process of porting SQLite's lexer and parser into Ruby. What began as a straightforward task quickly turned into a labyrinth of complex syntax and discrepancies that required astute attention and incremental progress. He reflects on the absence of a fully compatible SQLite parser in any language, emphasizing the significance of open parsers like Postgres in creating a robust ecosystem for tools and libraries.

    Stephen's excitement is palpable as he discusses Quickdraw, a groundbreaking testing framework that revolutionizes testing in multi-core environments. This innovation, along with the anticipation for RailsConf 2025 in Philadelphia, paints a bright future for the Rails community. With rich discussions on parsing, testing, and upcoming Rails events, this episode promises to inspire and engage both seasoned developers and newcomers to the Ruby and Rails landscape. Join us for an episode filled with excitement, insight, and a glimpse into the future of Rails development.

    Rails 8 takes the "one-person framework" to new heights. Enhancements to the SQLite adapter and the suite of Solid libraries now cement its standing as the top choice for solo developers and small teams. Still, the question lingers: Can I really go all-in on SQLite? Join me as we bust myths with benchmarks, showcase scalability with case studies, and sidestep pitfalls with practical tips. Concrete, real-world examples will illustrate how the Rails 8 feature set perfectly complements SQLite's power in creating resilient, high-performance production apps. You'll leave with a solid understanding of when SQLite does and doesn't make sense for your application and how to leverage Rails and SQLite's full potential in your next production venture.

    Hands-on building Rails applications using SQLite! This workshop offers a mix of the basics (rails new with SQLite and Solid gems, getting backups setup, core deployment considerations, etc.) and more advanced use-cases, like installing extensions, running multiple databases, full-text search, etc.

    Learn how to build and deploy a Rails application using SQLite with hands-on exercises! Together we will take a brand new Rails application and walk through various features and enhancements to make a production-ready, full-featured application using only SQLite. We will take advantage of SQLite’s lightweight database files to create separate databases for our data, job queue, cache, error monitoring, etc. We will install and use a SQLite extension to build vector similarity search. We will setup point-in-time backups with Litestream. We will also explore how to deploy your application. By the end of this workshop, you will understand what kinds of applications are a good fit for SQLite, how to build a resilient SQLite on Rails application, and how to scale to 50k+ concurrent users.

    This workshop is intended for Rails developers of all levels, though it will likely be most valuable to developers who have pre-existing experience with building and deploying a Rails application.

    The primary desired outcome is the developers feeling knowledgable and com- fortable with the differences and details of running a SQLite on Rails application. Secondarily and relatedly, this workshop will provide a hands-on introduction to the emerging SQLite+Ruby/Rails ecosystem of tools.

    You've heard the whispers, sensed the hype, but you're still not sure what all the fuss is about with SQLite these days. Join me as we explore the use-cases and benefits of running SQLite in a production environment. Along the way, we will learn why SQLite makes sense as your next production database and how to ensure that your setup is optimized for end-user performance and developer happiness. We will setup and deploy a vanilla Rails application to demonstrate both how easy that process can be and how solid the performance is out-of-the-box. We will then explore some of the more advanced features of SQLite and how to use them to your advantage. Finally, we will discuss some of the common pitfalls and how to avoid them. You will leave this talk with a solid understanding of how to get started with SQLite in production and how to ensure that your application is running at peak performance. Come along for the ride!

    If you start a new Rails project today, you’re probably going to pick Postgres for your database. And if you have a ten year old Rails app, you might be using MySQL. But Rails ships with support for SQLite, a lightweight SQL database. Can that lightweight database be used to make production-ready software? Stephen Margheim joins the show to help us answer that question.
