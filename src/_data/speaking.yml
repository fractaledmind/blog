    In this episode, we discuss SQLiteOnRails with Stephen Margheim.
    Stephen has contributed to Rails and he created a gem to bring this experience to all the Rails developers. 
    He has also created another gem called AcidicJob.
    
    SQLiteOnRails is something that is taking some place in the ecosystem, I am sure you will learn some new stuff.
    
    I hope you will appreciate this episode :).
