Iâ€™ve finally created an initial version of one of my favorite side-projects: [Togglicons](http://togglicons.com).

Visit and click around. You can choose:

- any two icons you want to toggle between,
- the color of the icons,
- the animation transition easing,
- the transition duration,
- and how rounded the icon edges are.

And it all just works!

In the coming month, I'll finish the full documentation and add that to the site.
