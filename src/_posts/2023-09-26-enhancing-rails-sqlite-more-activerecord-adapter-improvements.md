After opening [my first few ActiveRecord PRs]({% link _posts/2023-09-15-enhancing-rails-sqlite-activerecord-adapter-improvements.md %}) last week, I kept going and opened 4 more to bring more key improvements to the [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) adapter.

All in all, I have opened 3 pull requests to bring larger, existing ActiveRecord features to the `SQLite3Adapter`:

* [support auto-populating columns and custom primary keys](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/49290)
* [support generated columns](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/49346)
* [support deferred foreign keys](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/49376)

In addition, I have also opened 3 additional pull requests to add some new, `SQLite`-specific features:

* [support `||` concatenation in default functions](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/49287)
* [performance tune default connection configurations](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/49349)
* [add `retries` option as alternative to `timeout`](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/49352)

I am chatting with the Core team and _trying_ to get all of this work into the upcoming 7.1 release, but nothing is set in stone yet.

Regardless, I thought it would be useful to take the next few posts and dive into the details and use-cases for each of these features in turn. I already started this by writing up how to setup [custom primary keys]({% link _posts/2023-09-22-enhancing-rails-sqlite-ulid-primary-keys.md %}) in your Rails app.

Up next, I will write up how to use generated columns in your Rails app. So, keep your eyes out ðŸ‘€
