    <h2 class="">Hey Taylor üëã,</h2>
    <p>
      I‚Äôm Stephen. I am an American expat living in Berlin, Germany with my wife and our 2 dogs‚ÄîTuck üê∂ and Ruby üêï (weirdly both emoji are pretty accurate depictions). We met at Rails World this year in Toronto (I showed you and the "PHP Crew" where to find the food trucks). I ºm a Rails guy, not a Laravel guy, but I ºve been a fan of you and Laravel for years. I know that I could do the work of my life alongside the team at <em>Laravel Inc</em>, and if you give me 5 minutes of your time, I want to explain why.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, I can help you expand Laravel ºs reach into the Rails ecosystem and market, specifically with Laravel Cloud and Nightwatch. I can also be a high-leverage addition to the team as an experienced engineering leader and seasoned fullstack developer.
    </p>

  </li>

  <li>
    <h2>I can help Laravel meet Rails</h2>
    <p>
      The recent investment in <em>Laravel Inc</em> hints at bigger plans. My hunch? You ºre eyeing expansion beyond the Laravel framework. As a Rails developer who ºs longed to use Laravel products, this excites me. I want to help you communicate the power, flexibility, and elegance of Laravel Cloud to the Rails community, but I also want to help you tailor your offerings for Rails apps, ensuring they feel just as polished and intuitive as they do for Laravel apps.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you ºre looking to bring your products to a wider audience, particularly Rails, I ºm uniquely positioned to help as a respected community member on the rise. In 2024 alone I spoke at <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/speaking/">10 conferences</a>, including the 2 largest Rails conferences: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l56IBad-5aQ">Rails World</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPNeWdaJrL0">RailsConf</a>. I was also a guest on many of the <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/speaking/">major Rails podcasts</a>. After such a busy year and a half, I am now good friends with or know many of the movers and shakers in the Rails community. And I ºm only getting started. In November I recorded the first guest course with <a href="https://tryhardstudios.com">Try Hard Studios</a> to teach fullstack application development with Rails and SQLite. And I will be back on the conference circuit in 2025 with a handful of new talks on topics ranging from resilient background jobs, building a SQL parser, and building vector search into your Rails app with SQLite.
    </p>
    <p>
      After I decided to become an active member of the community, much of the last 18 months has focused on making Rails work better with SQLite. I contributed <a href="https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/stephen-margheim/commits">the bulk</a> of the foundational features that made Rails 8 the best web framework for building and deploying SQLite-backed applications, including  <a href="https://github.com/sparklemotion/sqlite3-ruby/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Afractaledmind+is%3Aclosed">multiple PRs to the `sqlite3-ruby` gem</a> (I ºm now a top-5 contributor), some even <a href="https://github.com/sparklemotion/sqlite3-ruby/pull/463/files#diff-5a393d9872eb01d26891fb3583a9415dd3e4e5635964c82aee5263fde02ecde3">written in C</a>. And by sharing my journey I have become <a href="https://x.com/levelsio/status/1763599554409079286?s=20">recognized</a> as one of <em>the</em> experts on SQLite in the Ruby community.
    </p>
    <p>
      Working and speaking on how a database engine integrates with a web framework has led me to explore the intricasies of web application deployment by experimenting with <a href="https://heroku.com">many</a> <a href="https://render.com">of</a> <a href="https://fly.io">the</a> <a href="https://hatchbox.io">providers</a>. I am so excited about the potential of Laravel Cloud for Rails applications, and I would love to help bring that platform to the Rails community. Beyond that though, I also think that I could help you as you grow the <em>Laravel Inc</em> team and products.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h2>I ºm an experienced leader</h2>
    <p>
      During my 5 years at <a href="https://test.io">Test IO</a>, I evolved from a senior engineer to the Director of Engineering, overseeing a 45+ person engineering department across 5 teams, 4 products, and 4 programming languages. Along the way I helped the department evolve from a fully on-site culture to remote-only, built a leadership team, implemented <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup">Shape Up principles</a>, and truthfully had a blast doing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have faced the problems that come with doubling a team year over year for a few years, or that come from having a team that is 100% remote. I have also experienced how well that can work when you have solid structures and processes in place. After I introduced the <strong>Shape Up</strong> method to our Product and Engineering department, we spent the next four years growing our teams and the products we support, while still only ever having two projects require a "killswitch". More importantly for me, each year our developer satisfaction score was well above the average of our parent company, which employs over 20k software engineers worldwide. I am confident that I could help <em>Laravel Inc</em> navigate its growth by bringing my experience running Shape Up across multiple teams with multiple products for years.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h2>What ºs next?</h2>
    <p>
      I am certain that I could do the best work of my life with you and the team at <em>Laravel Inc</em>, and I genuinely believe that I could help take Laravel beyond Laravel. But, I know that I am effectively a stranger from the internet, so I wanted to offer a few people that you know and respect who know and respect me. Feel free to reach out to any of them to get a sense of who I am and what I am capable of: <a href="https://aaronfrancis.com">Aaron Francis</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nonconstant/">Irina Nazarova</a>, or <a href="https://excid3.com">Chris Oliver</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I truly appreciate you taking the time to read this, and I really hope that you would consider at least having a conversation with me. I would love to talk strategies for how to make Laravel Cloud a major player in the Rails deployment ecosystem and how to setup a growing team for success.
