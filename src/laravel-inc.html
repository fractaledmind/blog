    <h2 class="">Hey Taylor üëã,</h2>
    <p>
      I‚Äôm Stephen. I am an American expat living in Berlin with my wife and our 2 dogs‚ÄîTuck üê∂ and Ruby üêï (weirdly both emoji are pretty accurate depictions). We met at Rails World this year in Toronto (I showed you and the "PHP Crew" where to find the food trucks). I'm a Rails guy, not a Laravel guy, but I've been a fan of you and Laravel for years. I know that I could do the work of my life alongside the team at <em>Laravel Inc</em>, and if you give me 5 minutes of your time, I want to explain why.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, I can help you expand Laravel's reach into the Rails ecosystem and market, but I can also be a high-leverage addition to the team regardless as an seasoned fullstack developer and experienced engineering leader.
    </p>

    <div class="grid grid-cols-2 items-end gap-1">
      <img src="{{ '/images/me-and-geniya.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Me and wife, Geniya, on the Brooklyn bridge" class="!mt-0" />
      <img src="{{ '/images/pups.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="My two dogs, Tuck and Ruby" class="!mt-0" />
    </div>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h2>Laravel beyond Laravel</h2>
    <p>
      The recent investment in <em>Laravel Inc</em> hints at bigger plans. My hunch? You're eyeing expansion beyond the Laravel framework. As a Rails developer who's longed to use Laravel products, this excites me. I can help you tailor your offerings to the Rails community, ensuring they feel just as polished and intuitive as they do for Laravel devs.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're looking to bring your products to a wider audience, particularly Rails, I'm uniquely positioned to help. With my deep Rails expertise and respect within the community, I can ensure your expansion feels natural and meets the high standards Rails developers expect.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h2>I'm a respected Rails community member</h2>
    <p>
      With over a decade of Rails experience, I've become a recognizable voice in the community. I've been featured on <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/speaking/">major Rails podcasts</a>, spoken at <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/speaking/">numerous conferences</a>, and maintain an <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/posts/">active blog</a> on web development topics. My social media presence includes <a href="https://twitter.com/fractaledmind">3k Twitter followers</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/fractaledmind.bsky.social">1.1k on Bluesky</a>. I am also <a href="https://x.com/levelsio/status/1763599554409079286?s=20">recognized</a> as one of <em>the</em> experts in SQLite in the Ruby community and the wider web-dev space.
    </p>
    <p>
      More importantly, I'm positioned to potentially influence Rails itself. As a <a href="https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/stephen-margheim/commits">top-400 Rails core contributor</a>, I understand what it takes to get features and fixes merged into the framework‚Äîa valuable asset for tailoring Laravel products to the Rails ecosystem.
    </p>
    <p>
      That said, I recognize you may not be planning to expand into the Rails ecosystem soon, or at all. While I'd love to spearhead such an expansion, I believe I'd be a valuable addition to the Laravel team regardless. I have a track record of quickly learning new technologies, experience leading remote engineering teams, and a passion for building delightful, accessible, and polished interfaces that align with Laravel's product philosophy.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h2>I'm a quick learner</h2>
    <p>
      At this point one and a half years ago, I had never read or written a line of C, knew nearly nothing about SQLite, and had only contributed one small documentation fix to Rails core. Since then, I have made <a href="https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/stephen-margheim/commits">16 commits to Rails</a>, contributed <a href="https://github.com/sparklemotion/sqlite3-ruby/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Afractaledmind+is%3Aclosed">multiple PRs to the `sqlite3-ruby` gem (I'm now a top-5 contributor)</a>, including <a href="https://github.com/sparklemotion/sqlite3-ruby/pull/463/files#diff-5a393d9872eb01d26891fb3583a9415dd3e4e5635964c82aee5263fde02ecde3">a few in C</a>, and also read large swathes of the SQLite C source code. I am presently in the process of writing <a href="https://github.com/fractaledmind/plume">a hand-written recursive descent parser for SQLite's dialect of SQL</a>. I know that I can learn PHP and Laravel quickly and effectively.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h2>I'm an experienced leader</h2>
    <p>
      During my 5 years at <a href="https://test.io">Test IO</a>, I evolved from a senior engineer to the Director of Engineering, overseeing a 45+ person department across 5 teams, 4 products, and 4 programming languages. Along the way I helped the department evolve from a fully on-site culture to remote-only, I built a leadership team, implemented <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup">Shape Up principles</a>, and truthfully had a blast doing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      My leadership experience spans the full spectrum: hiring, firing, promoting, conflict resolution, and guiding career paths. If Laravel Inc needs someone to build a strong culture, define flexible processes, and execute consistently, I'm your person.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h2>I'm a damn good fullstack developer</h2>
    <p>
      But, I'm not some manager that has lost my fastball. As I already mentioned, I am currently writing a parser for SQLite's dialect of SQL, and I am very comfortable with SQL. And in November I recorded the first guest course with <a href="https://tryhardstudios.com">Try Hard Studios</a> to teach fullstack application development with Rails and SQLite.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      Fullstack doesn't stop at the backend, obviously. On the frontend, I love pushing the boundaries of vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS. For example, I recently <a href="https://codepen.io/smargh/full/KKEbmyG">tried to implement</a> the <a href="https://www.superlist.com">Superlist</a> inbox page in Tailwind CSS.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> I also love to explore UX patterns to try and find an optimal balance between beauty, usability, and simplicity. As one example, I experimented with <a href="https://codepen.io/smargh/pen/MWqGKrp">two</a> <a href="https://codepen.io/smargh/pen/mdGLpEz">different</a> approaches to building a multiple file input in an edit form.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> For one other example, I tried a <a href="https://codepen.io/smargh/pen/qBQEaKj">few</a> <a href="https://codepen.io/smargh/pen/poONzWG">different</a> <a href="https://codepen.io/smargh/pen/bGxBazW">approaches</a> to an avatar component.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h2>I want to share and delight</h2>
    <p>
      Where I am from in Louisiana, we have the concept of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagniappe">lagniappe</a></em>, or "a little something extra." I want the things I build to have <em>lagniappe</em>.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> I most enjoy delighting people through speaking and sharing. I was one of the busiest people on the Ruby conference circuit last year, giving talks at <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/speaking/">11 conferences</a>. And I am so excited for my first course to come out in the coming months. When I look into the future of my career, I see myself continuing to share and teach, whether that be through speaking, writing, or mentoring.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Laravel Inc</em> is a company that too aims to delight. I see that in the quality of Laravel the framework, in the quality of the products you have built, and in the quality of the community you have fostered. I would love to be a part of that mission to delight as many developers as possible.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h2>What next?</h2>
    <p>
      As I said, I am certain that I could do the best work of my life with you and the team at <em>Laravel Inc</em>. And I genuinely believe that I could help take Laravel beyond Laravel. But, I know that I am effectively a stranger from the internet, so I wanted to offer a few people that you know and respect who know and respect me. Feel free to reach out to any of them to get a sense of who I am and what I am capable of: <a href="https://aaronfrancis.com">Aaron Francis</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nonconstant/">Irina Nazarova</a>, or <a href="https://excid3.com">Chris Oliver</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I truly appreciate you taking the time to read this cover letter. And I really hope that you would consider at least having a conversation with me. I am confident that I could be a valuable addition to the team at <em>Laravel Inc</em>, and I would love the opportunity to prove it to you.

      <p>At the application level, one of my earliest impactful projects was a library to run resilient background jobs called <a href="https://github.com/fractaledmind/acidic_job">Acidic Job</a>. One of my last engineering projects at Test IO was building an secure and anonymous credit card data transfer system for our real-payments testing service.</p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>I could only do so by eye as the source code is not available. I then spent the next two weeks before leaving for my wedding working to build a Rails clone using cutting-egde browser features (e.g. popovers and anchor positioning) and morphing. I streamed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuoosK264omOd8uszVOD0dzRfQc0uVJOK">the whole process</a>. It isn't perfect, I am still not satisfied with it, but I also didn't let that stop me from iterating, shipping, and sharing.</p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>In <a href="https://codepen.io/smargh/pen/mdGLpEz">one version</a>, I split the already saved files from the newly attached files and displayed them in two separate lists. In <a href="https://codepen.io/smargh/pen/MWqGKrp">the other</a>, I combined them into a single list but varied their styling. I believe that the second approach is more intuitive and user-friendly, but I am not sure. I would love to hear your thoughts.</p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:4" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>I <a href="https://codepen.io/smargh/pen/qBQEaKj">started off</a> with a simple screen name text input that generates a deterministic avatar from <a href="https://boringavatars.com">Boring avatars</a>. I <a href="https://codepen.io/smargh/pen/poONzWG">then</a> tried using a generated avatar from <a href="https://avvvatars.com">avvvatars</a> along with a file upload button. <a href="https://codepen.io/smargh/pen/bGxBazW">Finally</a>, I allowed the user to choose if they wanted a shape or initial-based avatar or upload a custom image. Polish isn't simply how it looks statically, but how it works and feels to use.</p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:4" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>In fact, my very first open source project was <a href="https://codepen.io/smargh/pen/ZGNWmY">a CSS library</a> to provide a collection of icons that you could visually toggle between, like an up-chevron morphing into a down-chevron. I hope even this cover letter page sparks a bit of delight. I added the zero-padded list item numbers as an homage to the <a href="https://37signals.com">37signals home page</a>, as I know that we are both fans of their work.</p>
