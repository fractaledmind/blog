    <h2 class="">Hey Taylor üëã,</h2>
    <p>
      I‚Äôm Stephen. I am an American expat living in Berlin with my wife and our 2 dogs‚ÄîTuck üê∂ and Ruby üêï (weirdly both emoji are pretty accurate depictions). We met at Rails World this year in Toronto; I showed you and the "PHP Crew" where to find the food trucks. I'm a Rails guy, not a Laravel guy, but I've been a fan of you and Laravel for years. I know that I could do the work of my life alongside the team at <em>Laravel Inc</em>, and if you give me 10 minutes of your time, I want to explain why.
    </p>

    <div class="grid grid-cols-2 items-end gap-1">
      <img src="{{ '/images/me-and-geniya.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Me and wife, Geniya, on the Brooklyn bridge" class="!mt-0" />

    </div>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h2>Let's get something out of the way</h2>
    <p>
      If you need to hire someone who is an <em>expert</em> in Laravel and PHP <em>on day one</em>, I am <strong>not</strong> your guy. But, I am betting that you are looking for more than just a Laravel expert. I think you are looking for people who bring a wide range of skills and experience, people who sweat the details, care about clean and clear communication, and who are passionate about building the best possible products for developers. If so, then I <em>am</em> <strong>that guy</strong>.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h2>Laravel beyond Laravel</h2>
    <p>
      When I heard the news of the investment in <em>Laravel Inc</em>, I had two immediate thoughts. First, I was excited for you and the team. But, second, I thought: "They probably have aspirations to expand the reach of Laravel the company beyond serving devs that use Laravel the framework." And that thought started to get me particularly excited, because I have wished that I could use Laravel's products in my Rails apps for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then I got <em>really</em> excited, because I realized that I might actually be able to work at <em>Laravel Inc</em> and help make that happen. You see, I've actually found Laravel, both the company and the framework, to be a paradigmatic example of precisely the characteristics that led me to fall in love with Ruby. When I think of both Laravel and Ruby, I think of <strong>elegance</strong> and <strong>quality</strong>. I love Ruby because Ruby not only allows me but encourages me to write code that is elegant and beautiful, and I want to write elegant code because I hold myself and what I create to the highest quality standards. And if there is one that that shines through in your persona and in Laravel more generally, it is that same commitment to elegance and quality. I truly think you are a Rubyist at heart that happened to know PHP best when you started Laravel.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, I am hoping that you are looking for people who can help you build the best possible products for a wider audience. I am also hoping that Rails is one of the next communities where you plan to bring your products. If so, I <em>know</em> that you would want to ensure that the experience of using your products would feel <em>at the very least</em> 90% as good as it does for Laravel devs, which means tailoring the experience to the idioms and conventions of Rails. I can help you do that.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h2>I'm a respected member of the Rails community</h2>
    <p>
      I have been a Rails developer for over a decade, and in the last few years I have been on <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/speaking/">most of the Rails-related podcasts</a> and spoken at <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/speaking/">10+ conferences</a>. I also <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/posts/">write regularly</a> on various topics in web development, averaging around 1,000 page views per month. On social media I have <a href="https://twitter.com/fractaledmind">3k followers on Twitter/X</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/fractaledmind.bsky.social">1.1k followers on Bluesky</a>. Yes, these are empty vanity metrics, and yes these are small numbers compared to someone of your stature, but I hope they offer a constellation of evidence that I am indeed a respected member of the Rails community.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, for the purposes of taking Laravel to the next level, I think that you need someone who is not only well-respected in the Rails community, but also someone who could conceivably get features and fixes merged into Rails itself, on the chance that tailoring your products to Rails would benefit from changes to Rails.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h2>I have a track record of many meaningful additions to Rails itself</h2>
    <p>
      I am a <a href="https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/stephen-margheim/commits">top-400 Rails core contributor</a> all-time. I know what it takes to get a pull request merged into Rails. Many of those contributions center on the work I did to improve Rails' story for deploying SQLite-backed applications. And as a result of that work over the last few years, I am now <a href="https://x.com/levelsio/status/1763599554409079286?s=20">recognized</a> as one of <em>the</em> experts in SQLite in the Ruby community.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of that being said, I recognize that this is a decent chance that you are either not planning to expand into the Rails ecosystem or not planning to do so anytime soon. And while I would absolutely love to the spearhead for such an expansion, I genuinely believe that I would be a meaningful addition to the Laravel team regardless. I have a track record of learning new technologies and tools quickly and deeply. I have the skills and experience necessary to be a leader in remote engineering teams. And I have a passion for building delightful, accessible, and polished interfaces that I believe would be a great fit for Laravel's products.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h2>I'm a quick learner</h2>
    <p>
      At this point one and a half years ago, I had never read or written a line of C, knew nearly nothing about SQLite, and had only contributed one small documentation fix to Rails core. Since then, I have made <a href="https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/stephen-margheim/commits">16 commits to Rails</a>, contributed <a href="https://github.com/sparklemotion/sqlite3-ruby/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Afractaledmind+is%3Aclosed">multiple PRs to the `sqlite3-ruby` gem (I'm now a top-5 contributor)</a>, including <a href="https://github.com/sparklemotion/sqlite3-ruby/pull/463/files#diff-5a393d9872eb01d26891fb3583a9415dd3e4e5635964c82aee5263fde02ecde3">a few in C</a>, and also read large swathes of the SQLite C source code. I am presently in the process of writing <a href="https://github.com/fractaledmind/plume">a hand-written recursive descent parser for SQLite's dialect of SQL</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, when I got my first job in tech after leaving graduate school in Classical Studies, I had never written a line of Ruby and knew nothing about Rails. Nonetheless, within 6 months of starting I was promoted from junior to mid-level Rails developer. In my second job, I was again promoted after 6 months in the role. This time, though, I was promoted to an engineering management role, and I have spent the last 4 years growing our team from 6 on-site, full-stack engineers maintaining one product to a department of 45+ remote engineers who have built and now maintain 4 products.
    </p>
    <p>
      My key to learning new topics, tools, or technologies is to dive in head first and build something. I am a hands-on learner. Whether it is things for work or things I am simply interested in, I learn by doing. Being such a hands-on "manager-of-one" has granted me essentially all of my opportunities. I got into tech by building tools to be a more effective and efficient scholar. I got my first job from building Alfred workflows. And I now have a reputation in the Ruby community for my work on SQLite because I built various applications using SQLite and numerous tools on top of SQLite. I am confident that I can learn and contribute to Tailwind Labs in the same way.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h2>I'm an experienced leader</h2>
    <p>
      As I just described, I spent 5 years leading a growing remote engineering department at <a href="https://test.io">Test IO</a>. When I joined the company at the start of 2019, I was a senior engineer working alongside 6 other engineers in our Berlin office. When the company was acquired 5 months later, the co-founder and CTO asked me to become the Engineering Manager. Within the year we had doubled our team from 7 to 15, with all of the new team members working remotely. Over the hext 2 years, the team doubled in size each year and went fully remote with the onset of the pandemic. When I decided to leave near the end of 2024, I was the Director of Engineering for a 45+ person department spanning 5 teams, 4 products, and 4 different programming languages. I had created and trained up an engineering leadership team of 5, re-architected our work process to embrace <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup">Shape Up principles</a>, and truthfully had a blast doing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have had to hire people, fire people, promote people, demote people, run meetings, resolve conflicts, guide people through their career paths, and so much more. If <em>Laravel Inc</em> would benefit from an experienced engineering leader who can help build a strong culture, define flexible but defined processes, and execute on those processes in a repeatable manner, I am confident that I could be that person.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h2>I'm a damn good fullstack developer</h2>
    <p>
      But, I'm not some manager that has lost my fastball. After reaching my ceiling at Test IO, I am currently in a pure engineering role at <a href="https://prevail.ai">Prevail Legal</a>. And I truly am a fullstack developer. As I already mentioned, I am currently writing a parser for SQLite's dialect of SQL, and I am very comfortable with SQL. At the application level, one of my earliest impactful projects was a library to run resilient background jobs called <a href="https://github.com/fractaledmind/acidic_job">Acidic Job</a>. One of my last engineering projects at Test IO was building an secure and anonymous credit card data transfer system for our real-payments testing service. And in November I recorded the first guest course with <a href="https://tryhardstudios.com">Try Hard Studios</a> to teach fullstack application development with Rails and SQLite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fullstack doesn't stop at the backend, obviously. On the frontend, I love pushing the boundaries of vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS. I recently <a href="https://codepen.io/smargh/full/KKEbmyG">tried to implement</a> the <a href="https://www.superlist.com">Superlist</a> inbox page in Tailwind CSS, which I could only do by eye as the source code is not available. I then spent the next two weeks before leaving for my wedding working to build a Rails clone using cutting-egde browser features (e.g. popovers and anchor positioning) and morphing. I streamed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuoosK264omOd8uszVOD0dzRfQc0uVJOK">the whole process</a>. It isn't perfect, I am still not satisfied with it, but I also didn't let that stop me from iterating, shipping, and sharing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also love to explore UX patterns to try and find an optimal balance between beauty, usability, and simplicity. As one example, I experimented with two different approaches to building a multiple file input in an edit form. In <a href="https://codepen.io/smargh/pen/mdGLpEz">one version</a>, I split the already saved files from the newly attached files and displayed them in two separate lists. In <a href="https://codepen.io/smargh/pen/MWqGKrp">the other</a>, I combined them into a single list but varied their styling. I believe that the second approach is more intuitive and user-friendly, but I am not sure. I would love to hear your thoughts. For one other example, I tried a few different approaches to an avatar component. I <a href="https://codepen.io/smargh/pen/qBQEaKj">started off</a> with a simple screen name text input that generates a deterministic avatar from <a href="https://boringavatars.com">Boring avatars</a>. I <a href="https://codepen.io/smargh/pen/poONzWG">then</a> tried using a generated avatar from <a href="https://avvvatars.com">avvvatars</a> along with a file upload button. <a href="https://codepen.io/smargh/pen/bGxBazW">Finally</a>, I allowed the user to choose if they wanted a shape or initial-based avatar or upload a custom image. Polish isn't simply how it looks statically, but how it works and feels to use.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h2>I want to delight</h2>
    <p>
      Where I am from in Louisiana, we have the concept of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagniappe">lagniappe</a></em>, or "a little something extra." I want the things I build to have <em>lagniappe</em>. In fact, my very first open source project was <a href="https://codepen.io/smargh/pen/ZGNWmY">a CSS library</a> to provide a collection of icons that you could visually toggle between, like an up-chevron morphing into a down-chevron.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope even this cover letter page sparks a bit of delight. I added the zero-padded list item numbers as an homage to the <a href="https://37signals.com">37signals home page</a>, as I know that we are both fans of their work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, I look to delight people through speaking and sharing. I was one of the busiest people on the Ruby conference circuit last year, giving talks at <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/speaking/">11 conferences</a>. And I am so excited for my first course to come out in the coming months. When I look into the future of my career, I see myself continuing to share and teach, whether that be through speaking, writing, or mentoring.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Laravel Inc</em> is a company that too aims to delight. I see that in the quality of Laravel the framework, in the quality of the products you have built, and in the quality of the community you have fostered. I would love to be a part of that mission to delight as many developers as possible.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h2>What next?</h2>
    <p>
      As I said, I am certain that I could do the best work of my life with you and the team at <em>Laravel Inc</em>. And I genuinely believe that I could help take Laravel beyond Laravel. But, I know that I am effectively a stranger from the internet, so I wanted to offer a few people that you know and respect who know and respect me. Feel free to reach out to any of them to get a sense of who I am and what I am capable of: <a href="https://aaronfrancis.com">Aaron Francis</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nonconstant/">Irina Nazarova</a>, or <a href="https://excid3.com">Chris Oliver</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I truly appreciate you taking the time to read this cover letter. And I really hope that you would consider at least having a conversation with me. I am confident that I could be a valuable addition to the team at <em>Laravel Inc</em>, and I would love the opportunity to prove it to you.
